## Code for the paper "Super-Resolution Time-Resolved Imaging using Computational Sensor Fusion" by C. Callenberg et al.

This code allows running the reconstruction of high resolution light-in-flight images from low resolution SPAD data and a high resolution CCD image. All LIDAR type data shown in the paper - real measurements and synthetic scenes - are provided along with the respective parameters. 

The file `main.m` needs to be executed in Matlab block by block. See `main.m` for more instructions. 

Code used to produce the FLIM image in Fig. 4 of the main paper can be found in the submodule `HighRes_Reconstruction_Fig4`.
